# 👋 Hello there, I'm ByteLuka

##### Backend Developer/Machine Learning Engineer

Focused on performance, clean abstractions, and maintainability.

I have been programming since 2020 and work primarily with Python, Java, and C, with strong interest in **backend systems**, **DevOps**, **optimization**, and applied **AI/ML**.I care deeply about *how* software is written and works and not just *that* it works.

---

## 🔍 What I do

- Design and build **backend systems** with performance and resource efficiency as first-class concerns
- Develop **async**, **testable**, and **extensible** architectures
- Maintain **CI/CD** pipelines and **DevOps** workflows for reliable delivery
- Continuously **optimize** trade-offs between speed, complexity, and maintainability

---

## 🧠 Technical Focus

##### Languages

- Prefered: Python, Java, C
- Experience with SQL, C#, an basic Rust due to personal projects
- Experience with C++, CUDA, PHP, and JavaScript due to University projects

##### Core areas:

- Backend development & APIs
- Asynchronous and concurrent systems
- DevOps & CI/CD pipelines
- Optimization & performance-oriented design
- Machine Learning (ML, CV, DL fundamentals)

##### Foundations

- Data structures & algorithms
- Relational databases & query optimization
- Programming paradigms (OOP, functional, procedural, event-driven)
- Metaprogramming in Python (I love it)
- Basic networking & protocols

## 🚀 My prefered, personal projects

#### [Sim4SpecTerms](https://github.com/ByteLuka/Sim4SpecTerms)

A simulator for spectroscopic terms used in education and research

- Solves a real academic problem: computing electron configurations and quantum numbers (ML, MS) that were previously done manually
- Used by **students**, **teaching staff**, and **researchers**
- Designed and deployed end-to-end
- Focus on correctness, clarity, and practical usability

**Tech focus**: Python, Flask, numberical computation and optimization, backend design

#### [DiscordX](https://github.com/ByteLuka/DiscordX)

A unittestable, async Discord API wrapper with metaprogramming-driven command definitions (still in development)

- Combines **Discord bot frameworks** with **FastAPI-like declarative design**
- Commands and subcommands are defined via classes, inheritance, and annotations
- Fully async and designed for testability and extensibility
- Architecture-driven project emphasizing long-term maintainability

**Tech focus**: Python, async/concurrency, metaprogramming, software architecture, extensible design

---

## ⚙️ Engineering Practices

- Versioned APIs (Discord, ClashOfClans)
- Asynchronous programming and parallelism (asyncio, MPI, OpenMP, CUDA)
- Database design fundamentals and query optimization
- CI/CD ownership for an integrated university project
- Experience with source-code generation (Uniface definitions to C# EF Core domains and enitities)

I optimize erly for performance and separation of concerns to reduce the need for disruptive refactors later.

---

## 🎯 Interest & Direction

- Backend systems with non-trivial constrains
- Optimization problems (e.g. NP-complete scheduling/timetabling)
- Software architecture as long-term investment
- AI/ML as a tool

I approach programming with the mindset that **ther is never a slingle "correct" solution** but **only different trade-offs**. I am not afraid of doing mistakes as I consider every mistake as an opportiunity to learn and improve.
